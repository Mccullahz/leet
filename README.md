# Leetcode practice
In this repository my goal is to improve my thought process in regards to several different languages. I am currently working on JS, but will move into python and go shortly. 

The current files here are from LeetCode's [30 days of JavaScript](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/) . I plan to branch off into other study paths but time will tell.
